# ArgentinaRPX
ArgentinaRPXLoader and RPX by cedkeChat and thanks to Rixcica

# How to use?
Open file (wutlib.sh) which will allow you to have the lib wut that the RPX ArgentinaRPX needs otherwise it will say that you have an error because you don't have the lib lol
Then you can ```make``` the ArgentineRPX project and the RPX Launcher!
